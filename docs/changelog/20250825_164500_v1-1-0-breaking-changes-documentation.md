## Breaking Changes Summary

### Removed Functionality
1. **fx_upgrade command**: Completely removed with no replacement
   - Deleted from pyproject.toml script entries
   - No migration path available
   - Users must implement custom upgrade logic if needed

2. **Legacy command entries**: All individual fx_* commands removed
   - fx_files → fx files
   - fx_size → fx size  
   - fx_ff → fx ff
   - fx_replace → fx replace
   - fx_grab_json_api_to_excel → fx json2excel

### User Impact
- **Existing scripts require updates** to use new command structure
- **Shell aliases and automation** need migration
- **CI/CD pipelines** must be updated
- **Documentation references** in user projects need updates

## Technical Decisions

### Version Strategy
- **Major version bump** (1.0.1 → 1.1.0) to signal breaking changes
- Follows semantic versioning principles for API breaking changes
- Clear separation from v1.0.x series for rollback compatibility

### Documentation Approach
- **Comprehensive migration guide** to minimize user friction
- **Automated migration check script** for easy assessment
- **Detailed changelog** with historical context
- **Clear command mapping table** for quick reference

### Backward Compatibility
- **No backward compatibility** for removed commands
- **Unified CLI maintains all functionality** through fx subcommands
- **Migration required** for all existing users

## Migration Support

### Resources Created
1. **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step instructions with examples
2. **Command Mapping**: Clear old → new command translations
3. **Check Script**: Automated detection of legacy command usage
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Support Strategy

# Architectural Decision Log

This document records important architectural and design decisions made during fx_bin development.

## ADR-006: Unified Local CI Simulation Strategy (2025-09-06)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: GitHub Actions tests failing, developers need instant local verification matching CI exactly  
**Decision**: Create unified `make test` command simulating complete GitHub Actions workflow  

**Rationale**:
- **Instant Feedback**: 60-second local run vs 2-3 minute GitHub Actions
- **Complete Coverage**: Security, safety, functionality, coverage, and quality in one command
- **Developer Friction**: Single command eliminates confusion about which tests to run
- **CI Parity**: Exact match with GitHub Actions ensures no surprises

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ All tests verifiable locally before push
- ‚úÖ Reduced GitHub Actions failures
- ‚úÖ Clear sectioned output identifies failure points
- ‚úÖ Integrated security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly longer test execution (~60s)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires all dev dependencies installed

**Implementation**:
```makefile
test:  ## üöÄ Run ALL tests (GitHub Actions simulation + everything)
	# Security tests
	poetry run bandit -r fx_bin/
	poetry run safety check
	# All functionality tests
	poetry run pytest tests/ -v
	# Coverage reporting
	poetry run pytest --cov=fx_bin
	# Quality checks
	poetry run flake8 fx_bin/
	poetry run black --check fx_bin/
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate minimal/full test commands ‚Üí Rejected: causes confusion
- No local CI simulation ‚Üí Rejected: slow feedback loop
- GitHub-only testing ‚Üí Rejected: wastes CI minutes on preventable failures

## ADR-005: Test Working Directory Management Strategy (2025-09-06)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: 26 tests failing due to working directory not being restored after test execution  
**Decision**: Mandate try/finally blocks for all tests that change working directory  

**Rationale**:
- **Test Isolation**: Each test must leave environment unchanged
- **Reliability**: Tests should pass regardless of execution order
- **Debugging**: Failed tests shouldn't affect subsequent tests
- **Common Pattern**: File operation tests frequently need to change directories

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ All 334 tests now pass consistently
- ‚úÖ Tests can run in any order without interference
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging when tests fail
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More verbose test code with try/finally blocks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Developers must remember this pattern for new tests

**Implementation**:
```python
def test_with_directory_change():
    original_cwd = os.getcwd()
    try:
        os.chdir(test_directory)
        # Test logic here
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_cwd)
```

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
- pytest fixtures with automatic cleanup (more complex)
- Context managers (not always suitable for test structure)
- Test decorators (adds abstraction layer)

## ADR-006: CLI Help Documentation Strategy (2025-09-06)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Users need practical examples without opening external documentation  
**Decision**: Embed comprehensive real-world examples directly in CLI help using Click's \b markers  

**Rationale**:
- **Discoverability**: Examples available immediately with --help
- **User Experience**: No need to search for documentation online
- **Maintenance**: Single source of truth for command usage
- **Click Integration**: \b markers enable proper multi-paragraph formatting

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Better user experience with immediate access to examples
- ‚úÖ Reduced support burden - users self-serve with --help
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting with organized sections
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Longer help text may overwhelm some users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must maintain examples in code rather than docs

**Implementation Example**:
```python
@click.command()
def ff(keyword):
    """Find files whose names contain KEYWORD.
    
    \b
    Basic Examples:
      fx ff test                        # Find files with 'test' in name
      fx ff config                      # Find configuration files
    
    \b
    Real-World Use Cases:
      fx ff TODO --exclude .git         # Find TODO comments
      fx ff .bak                        # Find backup files
    """
```

## ADR-004: Git Root Command Implementation (2025-09-06)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Users need quick access to Git project root for navigation and scripting  
**Decision**: Add `fx root` command with shell integration support  

**Rationale**:
- **Common Need**: Finding project root is frequent developer task
- **Shell Integration**: `--cd` flag enables `cd "$(fx root --cd)"` pattern
- **Cross-Platform**: Handles macOS symlinks and Git worktrees properly
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Uses only pathlib from standard library

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Simplifies navigation to project root
- ‚úÖ Shell-friendly output with `--cd` flag
- ‚úÖ Proper exit codes for scripting (0 success, 1 not found)
- ‚úÖ Handles edge cases (worktrees, symlinks, permissions)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional command increases CLI surface area

**Implementation**:
- Core logic in `fx_bin/root.py` with `find_git_root()` function
- Recursive upward search using pathlib's `parents` iterator
- Different output modes: verbose (default) vs path-only (--cd)
- Comprehensive testing: 12 unit tests, 12 integration tests

**Technical Decisions**:
- Use `Path.resolve()` for absolute paths and symlink resolution
- Silent errors in `--cd` mode for shell compatibility
- Support both `.git` directories and worktree files
- Exit code 1 when not in Git repository

- **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant tests
- **Better CI/CD**: Can run specific test categories independently
- **Test Isolation**: Separation helps identify test interdependencies

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Improved test organization and maintainability
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (unit vs integration vs security)
- ‚úÖ Easier to run specific test categories
- ‚úÖ Better understanding of test coverage gaps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial migration effort to move and update imports
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to update CI/CD configurations

**Implementation**:
- Created 5 test categories: unit/, integration/, security/, performance/, functional/
- Moved all test files to appropriate categories
- Consolidated duplicate test files
- Updated all import paths

## ADR-002: Separate CLI from Business Logic (2025-09-05)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Replace command had tightly coupled CLI and business logic causing "str expected, not tuple" error  
**Decision**: Refactor to separate core functionality from CLI handling  

**Rationale**:
- **Testability**: Pure functions easier to test without Click context
- **Reusability**: Core logic can be used programmatically
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Error Prevention**: Type safety between layers

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed critical runtime error in replace command
- ‚úÖ Improved testability - no need to mock Click context
- ‚úÖ Better API for programmatic usage
- ‚úÖ Cleaner code architecture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional function layer (minimal overhead)

**Implementation**:
- Created `replace_files()` function for core logic
- CLI `replace()` function now delegates to `replace_files()`
- Updated all tests to use new function
- Pattern can be applied to other commands

## ADR-008: Test Isolation Management Strategy (2025-08-30)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: BDD tests were causing test suite failures due to working directory changes  
**Decision**: Implement explicit working directory restoration using finally blocks  

**Rationale**:
- **Test Independence**: Each test must run in isolation without side effects
- **Global State Management**: Working directory is global state requiring careful handling
- **Guaranteed Cleanup**: Finally blocks ensure restoration even on test failures
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Clear restoration code is easier to debug than hidden state

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ All 301 tests now pass consistently (was 21 failures)
- ‚úÖ Test execution order no longer affects results
- ‚úÖ Clear pattern for handling global state in tests
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug and understand cleanup logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must remember to add finally blocks to new tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly more verbose test code

**Implementation**:
```python
def test_function():
    original_dir = os.getcwd()
    try:
        # Test operations that might change directory
        os.chdir(temp_dir)
        # ... test logic ...
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_dir)  # ALWAYS restore
```

**Technical Details**:
- Applied to ~15 BDD step definitions that change directories
- Pattern works for both passing and failing tests
- Alternative approaches considered: pytest fixtures, context managers
- Chosen for simplicity and explicit visibility of cleanup

**Lessons Learned**:
- Test individual files before full suite to identify isolation issues
- BDD tests commonly change working directory for file operations
- Always restore global state (cwd, env vars, sys.path) in tests
- Incremental testing strategy helps identify isolation problems early

- **Multi-path Support**: CLI commands need to handle multiple paths

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Complete BDD scenario coverage with table support
- ‚úÖ Flexible validation of complex output formats
- ‚úÖ Reusable parsing utilities for future scenarios
- ‚úÖ Support for advanced CLI features (glob, multi-path)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom parsing code requires maintenance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex than built-in pytest-bdd features

**Implementation**:
```python
def parse_table(table_string):
    lines = table_string.strip().split('\n')
    headers = [h.strip() for h in lines[0].split('|')[1:-1]]
    rows = []
    for line in lines[1:]:
        row = [cell.strip() for cell in line.split('|')[1:-1]]
        rows.append(dict(zip(headers, row)))
    return rows
```

**Technical Details**:
- Table parser handles Gherkin pipe-delimited format
- Directory structure validator compares expected vs actual trees
- Glob pattern support via fnmatch.fnmatch()
- Multi-path iteration in CLI command implementation

## ADR-010: Consistent Column Width for Tabular Output (2025-08-30)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: File sizes in fx filter detailed output were misaligned due to inconsistent column widths  
**Decision**: Standardize all size units to consistent 9-character width formatting  

**Rationale**:
- **Visual Consistency**: Aligned columns improve readability and professional appearance
- **User Experience**: International users reported alignment issues affecting usability
- **Standard Practice**: Right-aligned numeric data is industry standard for tables
- **Width Choice**: 9 characters handles up to "999.9 GB" while minimizing wasted space

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Perfect visual alignment across all file size units
- ‚úÖ Improved readability for users scanning file lists
- ‚úÖ Consistent user experience across different file size ranges
- ‚úÖ Simple implementation with minimal code changes
- ‚ûñ Slightly more horizontal space used (1 extra character for B/KB)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Before: Mixed widths
if size_gb >= 1: return f"{size_gb:>9.1f} GB"  # 9 chars
elif size_mb >= 1: return f"{size_mb:>9.1f} MB"  # 9 chars
elif size_kb >= 1: return f"{size_kb:>8.1f} KB"  # 8 chars - MISALIGNED!
else: return f"{size:>8} B"  # 8 chars - MISALIGNED!

# After: Consistent 9-character width
if size_gb >= 1: return f"{size_gb:>9.1f} GB"
elif size_mb >= 1: return f"{size_mb:>9.1f} MB"
elif size_kb >= 1: return f"{size_kb:>9.1f} KB"  # Now 9 chars
else: return f"{size:>9} B"  # Now 9 chars
```

**Technical Details**:
- Applied to `_format_file_size_aligned` function in filter.py
- All 36 filter tests updated to match new formatting
- Doctest examples corrected with proper skip directives
- Version bumped to 1.3.3 for this formatting fix

**Lessons Learned**:
- Small formatting inconsistencies (even 1 character) significantly impact UX
- International users provide valuable feedback on alignment issues
- Comprehensive test coverage makes format changes safe to implement
- Consistent column widths are critical for readable tabular output

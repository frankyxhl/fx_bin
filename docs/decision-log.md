# Architectural Decision Log

This document records important architectural and design decisions made during fx_bin development.

## ADR-001: TDD + BDD Testing Strategy (2025-08-30)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need comprehensive testing for new fx filter command  
**Decision**: Implement both TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)  

**Rationale**:
- **TDD**: Ensures code quality and test coverage from development start
- **BDD**: Provides business-readable specifications for stakeholders
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple testing layers reduce regression risk
- **Living Documentation**: BDD scenarios serve as executable specifications

**Consequences**:
- ✅ High confidence in feature reliability (23 unit tests + 25+ BDD scenarios)
- ✅ Business stakeholders can understand requirements through Gherkin
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage including security and performance
- ⚠️ Increased development time for test creation and maintenance
- ⚠️ Additional dependencies (pytest-bdd) for BDD infrastructure

**Implementation**:
- Unit tests in `tests/test_filter.py` following TDD methodology
- BDD scenarios in `features/file_filter.feature` with Gherkin syntax
- Step definitions in `tests/bdd/` with smart pattern reuse
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/bdd-testing-guide.md`

## ADR-002: Unified CLI Architecture (2024-08-24)

**Status**: Accepted (Previous Release)  
**Context**: Multiple individual command entries (fx_files, fx_size, etc.) created user confusion  
**Decision**: Consolidate all commands under single `fx` entry point with subcommands  

**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Single command easier to remember and discover
- **Consistency**: Standardized help system and option patterns
- **Maintenance**: Simpler package structure and distribution
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new commands without new entry points

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Improved user experience and command discoverability
- ✅ Consistent CLI patterns across all utilities
- ✅ Simplified package installation and distribution
- ⚠️ Breaking change requiring user migration from legacy commands
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained through legacy command support

## ADR-003: Click Framework for CLI (2024-08-24)

**Status**: Accepted (Previous Release)  
**Context**: Need modern, maintainable CLI framework  
**Decision**: Use Click framework for all command-line interfaces  

**Rationale**:
- **Modern Patterns**: Click provides contemporary CLI best practices
- **Automatic Help**: Built-in help generation and validation
- **Type Safety**: Parameter validation and type conversion
- **Testing Support**: CliRunner for comprehensive CLI testing
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add complex options and subcommands

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Consistent, professional CLI experience
- ✅ Automatic help generation and parameter validation
- ✅ Excellent testing support with CliRunner
- ✅ Easy to extend with new commands and options
- ➖ Additional dependency (minimal impact)

## ADR-004: Session Documentation Pattern (2025-08-30)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to preserve development context between sessions  
**Decision**: Implement structured session documentation in `docs/sessions/`  

**Rationale**:
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain development continuity across sessions
- **Decision Tracking**: Record architectural and implementation decisions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable future developers to understand project history
- **Quality Assurance**: Document what was completed vs. planned

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear development history and decision tracking
- ✅ Easy context recovery for future sessions
- ✅ Comprehensive project knowledge preservation
- ✅ Template established for consistent documentation
- ⚠️ Additional documentation overhead per session

**Implementation**:
- Structured session files in `docs/sessions/` with metadata
- Session index for quick navigation and search
- Project status tracking for current state awareness
- Quick-start guide for rapid context recovery

## ADR-005: Extension-based Filtering Implementation (2025-08-30)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need flexible file filtering capabilities  
**Decision**: Implement extension-based filtering with multiple format and sorting options  

**Rationale**:
- **User Demand**: File filtering by extension is common use case
- **Flexibility**: Multiple extensions, sorting options, output formats
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering without external dependencies
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across operating systems
- **Security**: Path validation and traversal protection

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Powerful filtering capabilities meeting user needs
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility with creation time handling
- ✅ Security-first design with input validation
- ✅ Flexible output formats (simple, detailed, count)
- ➖ Additional complexity in time handling across platforms

**Technical Decisions**:
- Case-insensitive extension matching for user convenience
- Creation time vs modification time sorting with fallback handling
- Human-readable file size formatting in detailed output
- Comprehensive error handling for file system operations

## ADR-006: Documentation-Driven Release Process (2025-08-30)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need comprehensive release documentation for user adoption  
**Decision**: Implement detailed release documentation with multiple formats  

**Rationale**:
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive documentation improves feature adoption
- **Developer Onboarding**: Clear documentation enables faster development
- **Quality Assurance**: Documented features are better tested and maintained
- **Stakeholder Communication**: BDD scenarios provide business-readable specifications

**Consequences**:
- ✅ High-quality documentation improves user experience
- ✅ Clear release notes help users understand new features
- ✅ BDD scenarios serve as both tests and documentation
- ✅ Established template for future releases
- ⚠️ Increased release preparation time

**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive HISTORY.rst updates with detailed feature descriptions
- Detailed changelog entries in `docs/changelog/`
- Session documentation preserving development context
- BDD scenarios as living documentation

## Decision Criteria

### Evaluation Framework
When making architectural decisions, we consider:

1. **User Experience**: Does this improve the end-user experience?
2. **Maintainability**: Can this be easily maintained and extended?
3. **Performance**: Does this maintain or improve performance?
4. **Security**: Are security implications properly addressed?
5. **Compatibility**: Does this maintain backward compatibility?
6. **Testing**: Can this be thoroughly tested?
7. **Documentation**: Can this be clearly documented?

### Quality Gates
- All new features must have comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- All architectural changes require documentation update
- Security implications must be explicitly addressed
- Performance impact must be measured and documented
- Backward compatibility must be maintained or migration path provided

### Review Process
- Architectural decisions documented before implementation
- Code reviews ensure adherence to established patterns  
- Testing validates implementation against decisions
- Documentation updated to reflect current architecture

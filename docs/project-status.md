   ```

2. **Consider Quick Test Command**
   ```bash
   # Add make test-fast for smoke tests (10-15s)
   # Useful for rapid development iteration
   ```

3. **Document Testing Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Update README with new testing commands
   # Document make test as primary testing interface
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions Optimization**
